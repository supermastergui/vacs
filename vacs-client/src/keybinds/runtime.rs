//! Platform-specific keybind listener and emitter implementations.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! This module provides a trait-based abstraction for capturing and emitting keyboard events
//! across different platforms. The design separates two distinct capabilities:
//!
//! - **`KeybindListener`**: Captures global keyboard events (listening/input)
//! - **`KeybindEmitter`**: Injects keyboard events into other applications (emission/output)
//!
//! ## Why Separate Traits?
//!
//! Listener and emitter are separate traits because they have different platform support:
//!
//! | Platform       | Listener | Emitter | Notes                                    |
//! |----------------|----------|---------|------------------------------------------|
//! | Windows        | ✅       | ✅      | Full support via Win32 API               |
//! | macOS          | ✅       | ✅      | Full support via Accessibility API       |
//! | Linux Wayland  | ✅       | ❌      | Listener via XDG portal, no emitter API  |
//! | Linux X11      | ⏳       | ⏳      | Stub implementations (to be implemented) |
//!
//! On Wayland, we can listen to global shortcuts via the XDG Desktop Portal, but there's
//! no standard API for injecting input events (security model). This means radio integration
//! (which requires emitting key presses) doesn't work on Wayland.
//!
//! ## Platform Selection
//!
//! Platform-specific implementations are selected at compile time using `cfg_if!`:
//!
//! - **Windows/macOS**: Direct platform implementation
//! - **Linux**: Runtime detection (see `linux.rs`) to choose between Wayland/X11/Unknown
//! - **Other**: Stub no-op implementation
//!
//! ## External Bindings
//!
//! The `get_external_binding()` method on `KeybindListener` allows querying OS-configured
//! keybinds. This is currently only implemented for Wayland, where shortcuts are configured
//! in the desktop environment rather than in the app.
