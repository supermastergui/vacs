# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The vacs project team and contributors take security bugs in vacs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions as well as resolving any findings in a timely manner..

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/MorpheusXAUT/vacs/security/advisories/new) tab.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the crates.io registry (directly on the crate's page via the "Report crate" button and selecting "it contains a vulnerability") or the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".

## Escalation

If you do not receive an acknowledgement of your report within a reasonable timeframe (keep in mind this is a private project, so please give us at least 7 business days of response time), you can escalate the issue by messaging the project maintainers directly via the contact methods available on their public GitHub profiles.

Additionally, you may message [MorpheusXAUT](https://github.com/MorpheusXAUT) **privately** on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/99580357451476992/) (Discord ID `morpheusxaut`).
